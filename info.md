          # … then 0.4 s fully off (sleep = LEDs off)
          - SleepTransition: 400
```

***For the scripts I used yeelight service to change the light modes (as this was a yeelight light) but just change it to the proper light you own and the way you can call it for changes in the modes/rgb and so on...***

# CS:GO game state integration for Home Assistant

This integration makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive game state changes available in Home Assistant.

## Setup - Home Assistant

First make sure that your instance is reachable via URL. Go to `Configuration > Settings > General` and set `Internal URL` and `External URL`.

Then go to `Configuration > Devices and Services > Integrations`. Press the `Add integration` button and add the "CS:GO game state listener" integration.

During the setup process, the integration will create a webhook and show the URI parameter for the CS:GO configuration.
Make sure to copy this code to your clipboard.

## Setup - CS:GO

CS:GO has an [integrated game state reporting engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/cjhcpy/game_state_integration_a_very_large_and_indepth/) that we will use no update Home Assistant.

The configuration will be added to your CS:GO config directory.
[How to find my config directory](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration#Locating_CS:GO_Install_Directory)

Open that directory and add a file called **gamestate_integration_homeassistant.cfg**.

Add the following content and replace the "uri" with the one copied during the integration setup:

```
"HomeAssistant Integration v1.2.0"
{
 "uri" "https://hooks.nabu.casa/xyz"
 "timeout" "5.0"
 "buffer" "0.1"
 "throttle" "0.5"
 "heartbeat" "15.0"
 "data"
 {
   "round"          "1" // round phase, bomb state and round winner
   "player_state"   "1" // player state (used for health)
 }
}
```

## Events

When everything is set up properly, the integration will start firing events as game state changes happen.

The following events are currently supported:

### csgo_round_freeze

Freeze time before a round started

### csgo_round_started

New round started

### csgo_round_ended

Round ended

### csgo_bomb_planted

The bomb was planted

### csgo_bomb_defused

The bomb was defused

### csgo_bomb_exploded

The bomb exploded

### csgo_game_stopped

The game has been closed

### csgo_health_low

Player health is between 11 and 30

### csgo_health_critical

Player health is 10 or lower

### csgo_player_flashed

Player flashed intensity as integer from 0 (not flashed) to 255 (fully flashed)

### csgo_round_win_ct

CT team won the round

### csgo_round_win_t

T team won the round

## Automations

Use these events to trigger automations that control your lights, sounds, fireworks, etc.

Have fun!
